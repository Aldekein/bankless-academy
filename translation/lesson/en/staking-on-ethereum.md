# Staking on Ethereum

Welcome, Explorer, to your next lesson!

Today we will be investigating the process of ‚Äústaking‚Äù ‚Äî a simple action you can take to begin building digital wealth.

`Staking` serves the same purpose as `mining` does on the Bitcoin network: it‚Äôs a mechanic for processing transactions on the blockchain, in exchange for rewards. It‚Äôs how we keep the network `decentralized`.

However, there‚Äôs a crucial difference between mining and staking. When staking on Ethereum, you don‚Äôt need a powerful computer to compete against others. By simply locking Ether (ETH) in a network `smart contract`, you help keep Ethereum running and get rewarded!

# Ethereum Wants You!

You can think of `staking` like an ‚Äúinternet bond‚Äù.

Much like supporting your government through bonds can give a return on investment, supporting Ethereum yields staking rewards. More importantly, like government bonds, staking is a way to show financial support for the values you stand for ‚Äî and the world you want to live in.

By participating in the staking process and facilitating transactions, your Ether is assigned to a `validator node` working to process transactions on Ethereum. The more Ether staked, the more nodes Ethereum has‚Ä¶ thus the more `decentralized` and secure it becomes. 

As a `staker`, you‚Äôll become a **guardian of Ethereum!**

It‚Äôs time to dive deeper into staking mechanics and uncover the simple, low cost opportunity to start your staking journey today.

Grab your gear, let‚Äôs go.

# Blockchain Security

`Stakers` are the line between a secure and legitimate economy on Ethereum, and one filled with `fraud`.

As a leading blockchain economy, Ethereum must ensure that every transaction is legitimate and no participant has power over others. This fairness, known as `credible neutrality`, is vital for avoiding  fraud, distrust, and the eventual collapse of an economy. Nobody wants to take part in an economy where others cheat. In the blockchain world, fraud looks like a user manipulating balances or creating non-existent crypto.

For a transaction to be considered valid, it must be approved by a majority of `validator nodes`. These nodes reach decentralized agreement using specialised systems called `consensus mechanisms`.

The mechanism changes depending on the blockchain, but the goal is always the same: **generate decentralized agreement, across the network, on the state of the blockchain.**

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/staking-on-ethereum/blockchain-security-c6000d23.png)

# Knowledge Check 1

How does staking prevent fraud on Ethereum?

- [ ] By granting validator nodes power over others.

	> ‚Ä¶

- [ ] By creating non-existent crypto for certain people.

	> ‚Ä¶

- [ ] By generating decentralized agreement.

	> ‚Ä¶

# Proof-of-Stake

On Ethereum, `validator nodes` use a `consensus mechanism` called ‚ÄúProof-of-Stake‚Äù to agree on the legitimacy of blockchain transactions. (This is where ‚Äústaking‚Äù comes from).

Users looking to run a validator node on their computer must gather and stake 32 Ether ‚Äî that‚Äôs a lot of money! In exchange for taking a large financial position in the network, the `node operator` gains permission to validate Ethereum‚Äôs transactions, and earn rewards. When a group of transactions are submitted to the network, a node is randomly selected to verify them ‚Äî with its results double-checked by other nodes to ensure honesty.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/staking-on-ethereum/proof-of-stake-8cc7d23c.png)

# Proof-of-Stake (Pt. 2)

When a node successfully processes the transactions, its `stake` grows. If the node is too slow or tries to approve fraud, its stake is `slashed` (a penalty charge is applied). In this way, staked Ether is a form of insurance; Nodes are incentivized to act honestly and keep Ethereum running.

For an attacker to approve fraud on Ethereum, they would need to gain control of the majority of validator nodes, and therefore a majority of staked Ether. That‚Äôs why having everyday users involved in staking is so important ‚Äî the `decentralization` fragments decision making power.

# Knowledge Check 2

True or False: Validator nodes caught processing fraudulent transactions will receive penalties.

- [ ] True

	> ‚Ä¶

- [ ] False

	> ‚Ä¶

# Validating Transactions

Let‚Äôs look at the step-by-step process of how nodes come to agreement using `Proof-of-Stake` consensus:

1. **Staking:** A staker runs a `validator node` on their computer, locking their ETH on the network.
2. **Block Building:** Users submit transactions, which are bundled into `blocks`.
3. **Node Assignment:** The network algorithm selects a node to process a block of transactions.
4. **Block Validation:** The selected node reviews the block, ensuring its transactions are valid.
5. **Cross-Verification:** Other nodes double-check and confirm the block‚Äôs validity.
6. **Blockchain Addition:** The valid block is added to the Ethereum blockchain. Invalid blocks are discarded, and the node involved is slashed.
7. **Rewards:** The selected node earns a portion of the block‚Äôs transaction fees, and additional rewards.

# Knowledge Check 3

What term represents the computer approving Ethereum transactions?

- [ ] Staker

	> ‚Ä¶

- [ ] Validator Node

	> ‚Ä¶

- [ ] Block Builder

	> ‚Ä¶

# Ethernomics

It‚Äôs important to understand where the yield for staked `Ether` comes from, and how it fluctuates based on various ecosystem factors. Simply put, rewards are a portion of transaction fees, plus a small amount of newly issued Ether.

The resulting yield can look like anything from a 3% to 16% return on staked Ether per year. The exact amount is based on two key factors:

- üìà **Network Activity:** In times of low traffic, the reward is lower, and in high traffic, they‚Äôre higher.
- üë• **Amount of Stakers:** With more participants, rewards are further divided.

Yields also change depending on how exactly you stake your Ether. We‚Äôll review our options shortly!

# Types of Staking

Running a `validator node`, the fundamental form of staking on Ethereum, currently requires 32 ETH. 

That‚Äôs a lot of money.

Fortunately, there are multiple ways to become a staker and protect Ethereum:

- üì° **Solo Staking:** Running your own validator node.
- ‚õ≤ **Staking Pools:** Joining a group of stakers, running a node together.
- üè¶ **Centralized Exchange Staking:** Joining a ‚Äúcrypto bank‚Äù node.

Each method requires a different amount of technical knowledge to get set up, and its own associated risks.

If you‚Äôre not yet comfortable with taking `self-custody` of your crypto, you should check out Centralized Exchange staking. (See our [Wallet Basics](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons/wallet-basics) lesson to boldly take custody of your crypto!)

If you‚Äôre comfortable holding your private keys, but don‚Äôt have 32 ETH, you can consider joining others in a staking pool.

Each method has either a positive or negative impact on network decentralization, **so if you want to become a guardian of Ethereum, you‚Äôll want to help decentralize the network!**

# Types of Staking (Pt. 2)

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/staking-on-ethereum/types-of-staking-pt-2-0adb0dc4.png)

**Solo Staking**

üü° Requires 32 ETH

üü° Technical Setup

üü¢ Decentralizes Ethereum

**Risks:** You may lose your private keys, or get slashed when your node is offline.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/staking-on-ethereum/types-of-staking-pt-2-fa455820.png)

**Staking Pools**

üü¢ Any amount of ETH

üü¢ Easy Setup

üü° Decentralized Options

**Risks:** There could be a bug in the staking pool‚Äôs smart contract, or you may lose your private keys.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/staking-on-ethereum/types-of-staking-pt-2-63e5ec68.png)

**Centralized Exchange Staking**

üü¢ Any amount of ETH

üü¢ Easy Setup

üî¥ Centralizes Ethereum

**Risks:** Your exchange could declare bankruptcy, and may lead to loss of your holdings.

# Network Centralization

Imagine Ethereum as a web of `validator nodes`, connected to each other.

The more the nodes are concentrated in one area, the less balanced and secure the entire web would be. For a strong, resilient web, we would want as many evenly-spaced connection points as possible.

If a single entity gained control over enough staked Ether, and therefore enough nodes, transactions would have no choice but to use their `centralized` section of the web. This entity could begin approving fraudulent transactions, or even denying valid ones ‚Äî destroying Ethereum‚Äôs `credible neutrality`.

As guardians of Ethereum, we must focus on staking methods that keep the web in balance, and `decentralized`. With the barriers of `solo staking` so high, let‚Äôs investigate the beginner‚Äôs option to decentralized staking: `staking pools`.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/staking-on-ethereum/network-centralization-4ef76ee7.png)

# Knowledge Check 4

What would happen if a single entity controlled a majority of staked Ether?

- [ ] They could approve fraudulent transactions.

	> ‚Ä¶

- [ ] They‚Äôd control all validator nodes.

	> ‚Ä¶

- [ ] Ethereum would stop processing transactions altogether.

	> ‚Ä¶

- [ ] All of the above.

	> ‚Ä¶

# Staking Pools

The best part about `staking pools` is that they‚Äôre entirely run by `smart contracts`. You don‚Äôt have to have met the other stakers in person ‚Äî and you don‚Äôt have to trust them (although you do have to trust the smart contract).

Staking pools are coordinated by `staking providers`, digital platforms connecting stakers across the world! In staking pools, a `node operator` stakes a portion of Ether and runs the node, and the other participants supply the remaining Ether. 

For their service, the node operator earns additional yield. For the remaining staking participants, their membership to the pool is represented by ‚ÄúLiquid Staking Tokens‚Äù (LSTs). These `tokens` represent a share of a pool‚Äôs staked Ether; The holder earns a portion of rewards proportional to their stake, and can redeem them for their stake at any time.

So by simply holding an LST, like Rocket Pool‚Äôs rETH, you own a share of a staking pool. Your Ether is helping to decentralize Ethereum, and earning staking rewards!

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/staking-on-ethereum/staking-pools-13994270.png)

# Knowledge Check 5

Which entity hosts the staking pool?

- [ ] The node operator.

	> ‚Ä¶

- [ ] The remaining staking participants.

	> ‚Ä¶

- [ ] The staking provider.

	> Correct! The pool is hosted via the provider‚Äôs smart contracts.

# Liquid Staking Tokens

The best thing about `LSTs` is that even while your Ether is staked and gathering yield, you control it in `liquid` form.

In this case, ‚Äúliquid‚Äù means that it can still flow throughout the ecosystem; It‚Äôs like being able to use your share of the staking pool‚Ä¶ as money! LSTs can be swapped, used as collateral for loans, or even deposited on `restaking` platforms for bonus yield.

This is also great because it further opens access to staked Ether: Often a staking pool has a minimum deposit for adding Ether the pool, somewhere around 0.01 ETH. With LSTs, you can buy even smaller increments of staked Ether on your favourite `decentralized exchange`.

Through cases like this, staked Ether starts to seem like an unprecedented form of money ‚Äî one that protects the ecosystem, while producing yield.

# Network Centralization ‚Äî Again!

Now, staking pools and LSTs have the same catch as the different staking methods: **they have varied degrees of centralization and decentralization.**

Staking providers like Rocket Pool have taken the steps necessary to allow anyone, anywhere to become a `node operator`, supporting new node operators and helping to decentralize Ethereum. However, many staking providers only allow a small range of their contacts to run their nodes, presenting high risk for centralized staked Ether.

If any entity gained control over 33% of all staked Ether, they could begin causing problems on the network. At 50%, they could begin threatening Ethereum‚Äôs `credible neutrality`. 

As of early 2024, staking provider Lido has a share hovering around the 33% mark.

Guarding Ethereum begins with choosing a decentralized staking provider.

# Knowledge Check 6

True or False: Supporting new node operators helps to decentralize Ethereum.

- [ ] True

	> ‚Ä¶

- [ ] False

	> ‚Ä¶

# rETH - Your Path to Decentralized Staking

It‚Äôs time to become a staker ‚Äî a guardian of Ethereum.

For today‚Äôs quest, we will be dipping our toes into a `staking pool`, over at Rocket Pool. It‚Äôs quite simple: mint or buy Rocket Pool‚Äôs `liquid staking token`: **rETH**. As the first step on your staking journey, you‚Äôll be funding a `validator node` so it can process transactions. You‚Äôll begin decentralizing Ethereum and earning rewards!

One thing we haven‚Äôt mentioned yet is how staking rewards are distributed. It depends on the staking method. On Rocket Pool, rewards are added directly to the value of the rETH token (which is why it‚Äôs worth a bit more). As you earn rewards, the value of rETH will continue to rise against regular `ETH`.

Good luck on your quest, Explorer. May your commitment to Ethereum‚Äôs decentralized future be greatly rewarded!
