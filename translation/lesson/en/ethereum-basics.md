# Ethereum Basics

Welcome, Explorer, to one of the most important lessons at Bankless Academy.

Today we’re looking at Ethereum: the next era of the internet. It’s a revolutionary platform powering a world of new internet `apps` and digital currencies.

A simple way to think of Ethereum is like the Google or Apple `app store`, but with some key differences:

- 💸 It uses a new type of programmable money called `cryptocurrency`.
- 📡 It’s a layer added directly to your internet browser, unlocking new applications directly on websites.
- ⚖️ The rules are agreed on by users and app builders. There’s no central corporation in charge.

To understand why millions of people are using Ethereum across the world, we need to look at its core mission…

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/ethereum-basics/ethereum-basics-b2e09ce5.png)

# A Global Town Square

Over the last forty years, the internet has become the town square of the world.

This online world allows total strangers to meet to exchange information, goods and services, or to build relationships, businesses and even social movements together. It’s the greatest intersection of social connection, expression and innovation that humanity has ever had.

**But it has one big problem…**

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/ethereum-basics/a-global-town-square-fcb47024.svg)

# Centralized Services

**The internet relies on a small group of corporations that don’t always have our best interests at heart.**

These `centralized services` have slowly grown an unprecedented control over the internet, because they act as `intermediaries` between most internet interactions.

Think your bank and Visa/Mastercard managing your purchases, Meta managing your social interactions, and Apple/Google managing your use of apps. As intermediaries, these businesses also take part in the trade, with their own rules, fees and intentions.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/ethereum-basics/centralized-services-adf5be05.svg)

# One-sided Trades

We call them `centralized services` because all the power is in one place. It’s often like being stuck under the rule of a king who knows exactly how to get what he wants from you. You might be surprised at the reality of your trades…

💸 Banks charge fees, then invest your savings for their own profit.

💳 Payment networks, like Visa & Mastercard, sell your purchase data to advertisers.

📞 Social platforms, like Instagram, can view your private conversations.

🪓 Content platforms, like YouTube, can freely delete creators’ entire careers — with no fair trial.

These shady rules and fees are often hidden away in the ‘Terms & Conditions’. Take a closer look at your favourite service agreements here: [https://tosdr.org/](https://tosdr.org/) 👀

# Knowledge Check 1

Intermediaries manage our internet interactions on our behalf.

- [ ] True

> Correct!

- [ ] False

> Try again.

# An Open Internet

😤 **Had enough of platforms that don’t respect your needs?**

---

This is the `value-extractive` internet we’ve become used to.

Called “walled gardens” for how restrictive these services are and how difficult they make it to leave, finding better alternatives can be time consuming and expensive. It often feels easier to just put up with the high fees, lack of transparency, and one-sided trades.

But doesn’t it feel like this problem is just getting worse over time?

We need a fairer, more reliable internet, beyond intermediaries and their walled gardens. We need an online space where power is held by the user — the way the internet was initially built to be.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/ethereum-basics/an-open-internet-31819e5b.svg)

# Peer-to-Peer Trades

The solution starts with changing how the internet is connected.

In traditional internet services, information or money from one `peer` goes through an `intermediary` checkpoint before arriving at its destination. Theoretically, these intermediaries can do whatever they want before the trade is complete.

**Peer →** **Intermediary** **→ Peer**

But there’s a second model of computer interaction, called `peer-to-peer` networking. It replaces intermediary services with automated, transparent processes, using computer code.

**Peer → Automation → Peer**

It’s like replacing your intermediary with a high-tech vending machine. Code, not kings. Services become more predictable, fees go down, and users regain control over their interactions.

As we’ll see, a peer-to-peer internet changes everything.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/ethereum-basics/peer-to-peer-trades-f043c3c0.svg)

# Knowledge Check 2

How does removing intermediaries improve your online interactions?

- [ ] By increasing costs.

> Try again.

- [ ] By reducing unwanted control by others.

> Correct!

# Ethereum: The Open Internet

⚖️ **Wouldn’t the internet be a better place if the same rules applied to everyone?**

---

Think of Ethereum like an internet shopping mall, where shops, security, accounting and rent are fully automated.

“High-tech vending machines” have replaced traditional services. With transparent programming, users can review trade terms, or audit the machine’s business practices.

Transactions in the mall are noted on a public record called the `Ethereum blockchain`. The blockchain tracks and stores digital property in the mall, removing the need for another classic intermediary — the bank!

Even the "landlord" role is automated. Any changes to mall processes are agreed on by users and builders, and instead of rent, a small tax on each transaction keeps things running.

On Ethereum, nobody is above the rules.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/ethereum-basics/ethereum-the-open-internet-ab794154.svg)

# The Decentralized Economy

To log into Ethereum you’ll use your computer or mobile device’s web browser. You’ll only need one account for the entirety of this new internet — a single login called a `crypto wallet`. This setup makes it easier to change services and escape “walled gardens”.

With the Ethereum app layer enabled, new websites with Ethereum functionality immediately grant you access to limitless digital goods and services. On Ethereum, the “high-tech vending machine” services we mentioned are called `dApps`. Much like regular apps for your device, there are dApps for:

- 🤝 sending or trading currencies, stocks and other digital goods, but with **low fees and 24/7 service**.
- 📻 connection with your favourite creators, but you can **unlock unique perks and opportunities** while ensuring your money goes directly to the artist.
- 👪 social media, but if you dislike the platform you can **easily transfer your social circle** to a new one.
- 🗳️ donating to your favourite projects, but even a $1 donation receives a **large matching bonus****, meaning greater impact**.
- ⚙️ renting out your computer’s processing power for **passive income**.

By removing intermediaries, banks, landlords, and individual accounts for each service, Ethereum has built a `decentralized` economy (this is the “d” in “dApp”). Without intermediaries, services get better and better as they compete on quality — not unclear business practices and control.

# Using a dApp

Using `dApps` is similar to using regular apps and internet services, but with a few differences.

Let’s simulate using a dApp for swapping `cryptocurrencies` online.

1. Connect your `crypto wallet` to the dApp’s website.
2. Confirm that you want to allow this dApp to interact with your Ethereum wallet.
3. Swap 50 DAI for 0.015 ETH, Ethereum’s native currency.
4. Submit the swap.
5. In your wallet, check the terms of your trade, and then sign.
6. Great! Your swap is being processed on Ethereum and will finalize shortly.

Plugging your wallet into a dApp and swapping cryptocurrencies is that easy. Now you can send it to friends, use it to make purchases, or try other financial service dApps.

# Knowledge Check 3

How does Ethereum’s market model give you greater online freedom?

- [ ] Automated services have less control over the user.

> Try again.

- [ ] Transparent business practices make services more predictable.

> Try again.

- [ ] A single, universal account makes it easy to switch between services.

> Try again.

- [ ] All of the above.

> Correct!

# A Global Banking System

⌛ **Do you want a faster, cheaper way to transfer money internationally?**

---

With the power of Ethereum, you can send and store `cryptocurrencies` without intermediaries too. You’ll discover better services at lower cost through its automated banking system.

⚡ With the power of cryptocurrency, money can be sent anywhere for as little as $0.01, and settle in seconds. Compare this to an international wire transfer, where banks charge 3-4% of your transfer in fees, and take 1-5 working days!

🔐 You’re the only person with access to your Ethereum account. There’s no intermediary loaning out your savings or controlling what you do with your money. Funds are stored in your personal `crypto wallet` — the same one you used to connect to a dApp earlier.

On Ethereum, you’re your own bank, and you feel like it!

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/ethereum-basics/a-global-banking-system-5a241dfc.svg)

# Sending a Payment

Let’s use another simulation to practice sending cryptocurrency. Try sending your 0.015 `ETH` to the Bankless Academy `crypto wallet`.

1. Unlock your wallet.
2. Inside of your wallet, select send.
3. Adjust the amount to 0.015 ETH by clicking “Maximum”.
4. Confirm the token and amount.
5. In contacts, select banklessacademy.eth.
6. That’s it! Your international transfer was done in seconds, and no intermediary could stop you.

With Ethereum wallets, you can own and send more than just cryptocurrency. Transferrable assets include any digital property that can be stored `onchain`. Digital art, club memberships, show tickets, stocks, website address ownership, and even real-world property rights have made their way onto Ethereum.

# Knowledge Check 4

True or False: On Ethereum, you can be your own bank.

- [ ] True

> Correct, with Ethereum you can be Bankless! So long as you don’t grant control to others, you have sole access.

- [ ] False

> Try again.

# How it Works

Let’s bring everything together by taking a quick look at how Ethereum makes it all possible.

As a `peer-to-peer` network, Ethereum is made up of tens of thousands of computers spread across the world. These devices, known as `validator nodes`, have been volunteered by their owners to help run the network. Using automated software, a validator will process transactions and verify the results of others to prevent fraud. In doing so, the validator generates `ether` rewards for its owner.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/ethereum-basics/how-it-works-08c71cad.svg)

# How it Works (Pt. II)

The transaction you submitted earlier was processed by these Ethereum network `validator nodes`.

1. Your ETH transaction was submitted to the Ethereum Network.
2. A validator checked your transaction for errors. Other validators double-checked their results.
3. Your transaction was added to the network’s public ledger, the `Ethereum blockchain`.
4. We received your transferred ETH in our account.

You might be wondering why these validators don’t just run off with your funds. The short answer is because Ethereum makes this virtually impossible. Your upcoming lesson, “Blockchain Basics”, will help you understand more.

# Common Questions

<details>
  <summary>❓ How was Ethereum created?</summary>

Ethereum launched in 2015. Initially managed by the Ethereum Foundation, it is now steered by a global community through `decentralized` governance. This distribution of power strengthens the network’s founding vision of an open internet.

</details>
<details>
  <summary>❓ Is Ethereum safe?</summary>

While your digital property on Ethereum can’t directly be stolen, you can be tricked into sending it to scammers, or make simple mistakes that cost you money. Take our ‘Web3 Security’ lesson to learn how to protect yourself on the internet frontier!

</details>
<details>
  <summary>❓ Is Ethereum legal?</summary>

Yes. Today, Ethereum's legality and adoption are so strong that even [big businesses are investing in and using it](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lawrencewintermeyer/2024/07/25/ethereum-on-the-brink-of-market-transformation-as-etfs-get-green-light/). Ethereum is also well protected against any sort of attack by a foreign nation. Realistically, shutting down Ethereum would require unprecedented global coordination, akin to NATO-level efforts. This is due to its `decentralized` network structure.

</details>
<details>
  <summary>❓ Is Ethereum used for criminal activity?</summary>

[Research performed by Chainalysis](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2023-crypto-crime-report-introduction/) shows that around 0.24% of cryptocurrency transactions were used for criminal activity in 2022. In comparison, 33% of US dollar transactions are suspected to be used for criminal activity. Ethereum’s high transparency also makes it easy for investigators to track and prosecute criminals acting `onchain`.

</details>
<details>
  <summary>❓ Is Ethereum bad for the environment?</summary>

As Ethereum’s daily usage grew, the community recognized its growing environmental impact and took steps to address it. This led to a network upgrade called "The Merge", [reducing Ethereum's energy consumption by 99.9%](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2369304-cryptocurrency-ethereum-has-slashed-its-energy-use-by-99-99-per-cent/). This achievement showcases Ethereum's adaptability to the needs of its users!

</details>
<details>
  <summary>❓ How can I invest in Ethereum?</summary>

To invest in Ethereum, you’ll have to own `ether` — the network’s native cryptocurrency. As the lifeblood of the Ethereum network, ether is used to own a financial share in the network’s success, make payments, and pay transaction fees. It can even be `staked` to run a network `validator node`, securing Ethereum in exchange for further ether rewards.
