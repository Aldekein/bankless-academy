# **Introduction**


Digital ownership is the new feature of web3. Using blockchains, cryptocurrencies, and NFTs, web3 gives ownership and power back to users. This online ownership of digital financial products is new for many, and that lack of experience gives opportunities for predatory people to scam and steal the assets of others. These scams work so well because most people aren’t aware of how they work. 


But, it's not just web3 that suffers from scams, web2 services like email and social media are full of scams as well. In addition, many web3 tools are still tied to web2 services like bank accounts or centralized exchanges so protecting those is important too. So congratulations, Academy Explorer, on taking the time to arm yourself with the knowledge that will protect you as you venture out into `web3`!


This lesson will cover:

- Web2 & web3 security.
- The most common ways people lose their funds and how to protect oneself from them.
- A general strategy for wallet security.
- How one can recover if they are the victim of a scam.

# Money in Web2


In web2, the institutions hold money on behalf of people. A user must prove their identity to an institution in order to access and use their money. It’s the same as a bank account or a `centralized exchange` (CEX); one needs a login ID and a password.


For a scammer to gain access to your money, they need this ID + password combination. Because the institutions are charged with protecting your money, fraudulent transactions can be reversed - like a credit card transaction dispute.


![Web2_Money.svg](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/f9ebddcf-8a37-4f35-b6d7-d57c7470e530/Web2_Money.svg?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20230530%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230530T191650Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=da4827385891fd5d1f668bcbdd0cd6a165109bd592a54f3fe3980a3b968e0ddd&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)


# Money in Web3 


In web3, money works differently. It’s more like a locked cash wallet; once money is spent, it’s gone. Only private keys control access to the wallet. So for a scammer to gain access they need the `seed phrase`, that special set of secret words, to access someone’s `private keys` and steal from their wallet. 


It’s very important to protect seed phrases; people should _**never**_ give their seed phrase to anyone for any reason. Also, never enter seed phrases digitally; digital photos, notes applications, and text files on your computer can all get compromised.


![Web3_Money.svg](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/4160352a-afb5-4d66-982f-d4c8d445d823/Web3_Money.svg?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20230530%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230530T191650Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=b4debf374065458af846b8b40a75c8d33b6d0e4187d5a7c289f613d44e8bcc4d&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)


# ✅ quiz


Unlike in web2, in web3, scammers only need the seed phrase to steal everything in a wallet, including tokens and NFTs.

- [ ] True
- [ ] False

# Secure Seed Storage


There are many methods for storing seed phrases securely, but a good start is to keep it on physical media (laminated paper or similar) and store it in a water- and fire-proof safe in your own home. **Do not** store a `seed phrase` as a photo or other digital methods - even in a password manager. 


Bad places to store seed phrases include:

- In a filing cabinet
- Digital notes application
- At your workplace
- Digital photo

Wherever you store your seed phrase, you should ensure that only you have access to it and that it is protected from loss and destruction. You never know what might happen in the future!


# Protect your Passwords


Healthy password usage and management is an important piece of everyday internet exploration.


Passwords should be different for each and every web2 service used online. This includes services like email, centralized exchanges, and other service accounts. It’s problematic if someone manages to get the ID + password for one account, but it’s far worse if that combination unlocks all of your accounts!


`Password manager` applications like 1password, LastPass, and BitWarden securely store and encrypt multiple passwords; they can even generate new high-security passwords and store them automatically. The user just has to remember a single master password. 


Do **not** store a web3 `seed phrase` in a password manager; it takes just one password breach to obtain all of your web3 assets and there is no one to recover your assets for you.


# ✅ quiz


Why are password managers helpful?

- [ ] People only have to remember their master password to use them.
- [ ] They generate and store strong, unique passwords.
- [ ] They encrypt passwords to keep them secure.
- [ ] All of the above

# Two Factor Authentication


`Two Factor Authentication`, also known as 2FA, is a secondary layer of web2 security.


Many people have had their web2 accounts hacked, or have had their money and credentials stolen despite having strong passwords. Web2 websites (and even `password managers`) often use a second layer of security 2FA as well. 2FA generates single-use codes sent to another device, in addition to the normal password, to enable website log-in. The other device could be a phone, a desktop computer, or even a small device you can attach to your keychain.


Phone (SMS) 2FA is better than no 2FA, but phone companies are vulnerable to scammers also. They can use `social engineering` to impersonate the account owner, bypass the company’s security checks, and gain access to the owner’s account - all without the real owner knowing. Authentication applications like Authy or Google Authenticator are more secure 2FA solutions.


![2FA.svg](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/5ecfc1b0-2dd5-4dc8-bf29-f83eb0b8410e/2FA.svg?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20230530%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230530T191650Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=6fafb0df931c46e6a2fc441f6ab0bd7a4d8d8e98b617fba91f98a038be224be1&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)


# ✅ quiz


Why is two-factor authentication strongly recommended?

- [ ] It’s impossible to hack an account when the user has 2FA enabled.
- [ ] It adds another layer of security to web2 accounts.
- [ ] It makes passwords stronger.
- [ ] All of the above

# Social Engineering Scams


In both web2 and web3, scammers use `phishing` tactics to trick people into giving up their passwords and seed phrases. Often they’ll pretend to be product support staff offering help, “Hello this is Metamask support”, or pretend to be an admin of a community, “New NFT mint, exclusive for our community”.


They use `social engineering` to pressure people. Examples include:

- “Time is running out!” - making you feel rushed.
- “Congratulations you won our giveaway!” - making things feel exclusive.
- ”Get early access to our pre-mint!” - generating `FOMO` in the person being scammed.

![Social_Engineer.svg](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/31929d2a-39b3-403e-85aa-63a7b024ddb3/Social_Engineer.svg?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20230530%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230530T191650Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=ffb96c59d464b2d2c3a8d4422a885ca0eadf2d0df40b8b66627199929413435d&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)


# Fear Of Missing Out


`FOMO` stands for the ‘Fear Of Missing Out’, it’s the stressful feeling that you’re not going to get a great benefit or opportunity unless you do something **right now**.


The best defense against FOMO is to simply take a step back from your computer and take a break. People don’t think clearly when they’re stressed, that’s why FOMO is such an effective scamming tool. By stepping away from the situation, it becomes much easier to spot the scams for what they are.


# ✅ quiz


How do scammers use social engineering?

- [ ] Pretending to be an authority in a community.
- [ ] Pressuring people with short amounts of time.
- [ ] Offering giveaways or free NFTs to generate FOMO.
- [ ] All of the above

# Social Media Safety


Scammers love to engage with users in social media environments like Twitter and the Discord servers of cryptocurrency projects. They will typically try to move to or even start conversations via direct messaging to avoid being spotted by experienced community members. It’s generally safer to talk in public areas, until you’ve gained more experience in crypto-culture.


However, no matter where you are talking to others, you should _**never**_ give your `seed phrase` to anyone for **any reason**. If anyone asks for your seed phrase or private key, they are a scammer. It’s that simple.


# Social Media Safety


Social media `red flags`:


🚩 **Language and grammar errors:** They’re/their/there, etc.


🚩 **FOMO:** “Don’t miss out!”


🚩 **Impersonation:** an admin, support desk, Vitalik Buterin, Elon Musk, etc.


🚩 **Guaranteed returns:** Nothing is guaranteed in crypto.


🚩 **Un****requested links and offers,** _especially in direct messages_.


![Red_Flag.svg](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/7f254ca3-29c5-46a5-9417-fd1d6cdb8eeb/Red_Flag.svg?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20230530%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230530T191650Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=32d442a3825c82c027439f618b9d7149707b4f013628d0d8a0e6281d9403774d&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)


# Social Media Best Practices


Practices for staying safe**:**


✅ If they have to direct message you to sell their product, you probably don’t want it.


✅ Check the project follower and member count - though these do not guarantee project legitimacy, quality, or stability.


✅ Verify everything with an outside source, like another official project account.


✅ If you’re ever uncertain, check with reputable members from a community you trust - and ask in public. Our [Explorer Community](https://lenster.xyz/u/banklessacademy) is a great place for questions like these.


![Best_Practice.svg](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/50cc279a-af2c-427b-b09a-2ea0d9d5e89f/Best_Practice.svg?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20230530%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230530T191650Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=9bda1a2d94499be6bb150f808c637449d52f1c55cdea0cae81140b3046923669&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)


# Scam-tokens


Besides social engineering, the second most common web3 attack is having `scam-tokens` sent to your web3 wallet. Scam-tokens are crypto tokens that scammers transfer to many wallets at once, in the hopes that someone will try to move or sell the tokens and trigger the malicious code hiding in the token’s smart contract.


Malicious contracts often require people to spend far more on a transaction than is necessary in order to sell these scam-tokens, and others can completely drain wallets; these scam-tokens could even be NFTs! If the problem isn’t with the smart contract itself, scam-tokens will often lure victims back to phishing websites where scammers try to trick victims into entering their `seed phrase` or other credentials.


The best thing to do when you receive random tokens is to not interact with them at all; leave them in your wallet and never transfer/sell them.


![Scam_Token.svg](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/7657342e-9b58-42b7-9aa7-f9c2dd43bc37/Scam_Token.svg?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20230530%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230530T191650Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=5b9abbdca7be039bb00fa31e2a0e8c757f284e87a2fc140419e0894a0ad69b3e&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)


# ✅ quiz


Why is interacting with scam-tokens dangerous?

- [ ] They could steal all of your ETH.
- [ ] They could steal other tokens from your wallet.
- [ ] They could lead to a phishing website where a scammer will try to get your seed phrase.
- [ ] All of the above

# Hardware Wallets


If you remember from our [Wallet Basics](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons/wallet-basics) lesson, a `hardware wallet` is only connected to the internet when you physically connect it to a computer or device that is connected to the internet. This makes your funds much safer as someone would have to physically steal your device and hack into it in order to find your `seed phrase`.


It is even possible to use your hardware wallet through many browser extension wallets, like MetaMask. By using this setup, you receive the convenience of a single wallet interface with the security of using a hardware wallet.


Ledger has [written their own guide](https://www.ledger.com/academy/security/the-safest-way-to-use-metamask) on how to setup MetaMask for use with their hardware wallet device.


![Hardware_Wallets.svg](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/dcecf258-31ec-476f-8d53-a809211f7ab4/Hardware_Wallets.svg?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20230530%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230530T191651Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=c5906f530add8c137514715001d2460a2f5a41be1199b565dfc31dbf11074c03&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)


# ✅ Knowledge Check


Is a hardware wallet more secure than a hot wallet?

- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

# Wallet Strategies


After adding a hardware wallet to your setup, one of the best ways to secure your funds is to keep them spread between multiple `wallets`. Here is a compartmentalized strategy using three separate wallets:

1. **Social Wallet:** A wallet that serves as your web3 identity for logins —  like for the [Bankless Academy community](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons/academy-community) or web3 social media — use a `hardware wallet` for extra security.
2. **Trading Wallet:** A `hot wallet` for trading and other activities involving funds that may need to be moved on short notice.
3. **HODL Wallet:** A `hardware wallet` for the long-term `HODL` — these are funds intended to hold for a long time. It’s recommended to _**not**_ use this wallet for interacting with smart contracts.

👍 **PROs:** Separation ensures that scams only threaten funds in _that particular wallet_ rather than _everything_.


👎 **CONs:** It’s more complicated to keep track of, but many wallet applications allow you to name your wallets.


![Wallet_Strategy.svg](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/af0e2e3b-d21f-4441-912d-dc83e8b83657/Wallet_Strategy.svg?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20230530%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230530T191651Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=3db5092637aff3a38598258bc871641768c6c7edeb020d9bda209260ac6dae09&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)


# ✅ Knowledge Check


We recommend keeping your funds _______________ for higher security.

- [ ] stored in multiple airdrops
- [ ] locked in multiple NFTs
- [ ] separated in multiple wallets
- [ ] liquid in multiple addresses

# Recovering from Web2 Scams


Hopefully you have not already fallen victim to a scammer. If you have, there are some steps you should take to secure your accounts once more.


For a scam involving a web2 service, like Gmail or Discord, you should:

- Change your password on the affected account.
- Where it’s available, use the “sign out everywhere else” button to kick the scammers off your account.
- Enable `2FA` with an authenticator app.
- Report the scam to the service involved.
- Ensure your email account is also secure.
- Discuss the scam with friends or trusted community members.

# Recovering from Web3 Scams


Contracts must be given explicit permission to spend tokens on Ethereum. The token `allowance` is how much of that token you’ve given permission to be spent by a specific contract. Keeping allowances low reduces the risk to your assets by a potentially malicious application or hacker.


Web3 doesn’t have anyone in charge of protocols to report scammers to, but you can still take action:

- Immediately move any funds still in the compromised wallet to a different wallet address, **make sure the new address has a different seed phrase.**
- Review and revoke the token `allowances` you have given on your wallet with tools like [etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker](https://etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker). Note that revoking allowances will cost gas. OpenSea has a [support article](https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/4416083190291-How-can-I-revoke-token-allowance-permissions-) walkthrough.
- Use a `hardware wallet` in the future.
- Warn others by reporting the scam to the affected community.
- Discuss the scam process with friends or trusted community members to see how you can protect yourself and others in the future.
