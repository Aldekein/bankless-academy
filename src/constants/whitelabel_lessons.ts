Now, the Bankless ecosystem as a whole creates user-friendly onramps for people to discover decentralized financial technologies through education, media, and culture.</p></div><div class="bloc2"><img src=\'/BanklessDAO/lesson/banklessdao-constitution/the-genesis-e6123df4.svg\'></div>'

If these proposals pass Forum approval, they go to Snapshot. If this budget is approved, the DAO multi-signers will issue disbursements in line with the approved budget.</li><li>Mid-season grants: Groups seeking funding over the course of a season will be directed to the Grants Committee upon successfully passing their Forum proposal. The Grants Committee is responsible to evaluate these requests.</li><li>Coordinape: BanklessDAO runs a monthly Coordinape for Guest Pass holders, L1s, and L2s to reward the community for continued growth and engagement. Just fill out a coordinape-request-form prior to the start of each round using the bot-commands channel on discord then you are eligible to allocate GIVE tokens to their peers using the <a href=\'https://app.coordinape.com/\'>Coordinape app</a> after the signup period ends and the allocation period starts.</li></ol></div><div class="bloc2"><img src=\'/BanklessDAO/lesson/banklessdao-constitution/funding-61f60a40.png\'></div>'
