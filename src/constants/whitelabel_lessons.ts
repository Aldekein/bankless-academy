Following the true ethos of decentralization, they stepped back and let the DAO take shape. While their media company, Bankless LLC, continues to operate as its own media node, the Bankless brand is further propagated through the DAO and its sub-DAOs. Today, the Bankless ecosystem creates user-friendly onramps for people to discover decentralized financial technologies through education, media, and culture.</p></div><div class="bloc2"><img src=\'/BanklessDAO/lesson/banklessdao-constitution/the-genesis-62a4642c.png\'></div>'

Following an opportunity for feedback, they collectively go to Snapshot for DAO-wide approval. If this budget is approved, the DAO multi-signers will issue disbursements in accordance with the specified budget.</li><li>Mid-season grants: Groups seeking funding over the course of a season will be directed to the Grants Committee upon successfully passing their Forum proposal. The Grants Committee is responsible for evaluating these requests.</li><li>Coordinape: BanklessDAO runs a monthly Coordinape for Guest Pass holders, L1s, and L2s to reward the community for continued growth and engagement. Just fill out a coordinape-request-form prior to the start of each round using the bot-commands channel on Discord and you will be eligible to allocate GIVE tokens to your peers using the <a href=\'https://app.coordinape.com/\'>Coordinape app</a> after the signup period ends and the allocation period starts.</li></ol></div><div class="bloc2"><img src=\'/BanklessDAO/lesson/banklessdao-constitution/funding-3fecfa12.png\'></div>'
