We are a globally distributed community representing numerous cultures, languages, and time zones. It\'s our highest priority to be the most welcoming and inviting onboarding experience for Web3. To this end, we encourage any conflict to first be broached between involved persons. If this does not resolve the matter we encourage team champions or guild coordinators to help resolve the conflict. If this still doesn\'t resolve the matter, parties are encouraged to approach the Ombuds office to help resolve the dispute. Our unity and internal cohesion are essential to accomplishing our mission.</p></div><div class="bloc2"><img src=\'/BanklessDAO/lesson/banklessdao-constitution/code-of-conduct-93a167e4.png\'></div>'
